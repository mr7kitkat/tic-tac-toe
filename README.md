# Project Title: Tic-Tac-Toe Web Game

Project Description:
The Tic-Tac-Toe Web Game is an interactive, browser-based version of the classic two-player game. This project involves developing a user-friendly web application where players can take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, attempting to align three of their marks (either "X" or "O") horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win. The game should be responsive, working seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
